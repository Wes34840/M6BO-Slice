## Elden bling

Elden Bling is a game made by us, inspired by Elden Ring. The Game is based on the entrance to the Stormfront castle, the first legacy dungeon. The game includes the small iconic entrance, the first two enemies in the game, and the iconic armor of the raging wolf set. It includes two weapons as well, and multiple mechanics, including combos, blocking and dodging.

The assignment of this project was rather simple. We were shown 10 seconds of multiple games, those that we chose to work on, had us remake the scene. By remaking, that went from every minor detail of the environment to the animations and even the mechanics, a 1 to 1 replica.

At the start, some of us were a little overconfident, we had to get to know each other to make sure we worked well together. The Trello quickly went downhill from the start according to the teachers. With user stories being too vauge or having simply too many that could be fit in one user story. Code wise, the start was smooth. There was no real hick. By sprint review 2&3, Our only problems were the lack of the models in the builds. Making the game was a headache in some aspects for the developers. With some difficult bugs jumping out every now and then, and even returning constantly. Team communcation was rather good and there was thankfully no drama between anyone. There was problems with dividing the tasks equally but that was eventually solved. overall, while we kept missing out tiny gaps in our user stories, at the end, our game turned out well.

The game is simple, you spawn, you move using WASD, you attack with a light attack with E and heavy with Q. You dodge in any directions using Ctrl, and block with Shift. You have a poise meter, when that is  0, you get stunned for a second. It swiftly comes back and is constantly regenrating. Your health stays low when you get hit, and eventually, you can indeed die. That is when you get a GameOver screen, and you lose.
